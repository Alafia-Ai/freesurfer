The 'run_recon-any' utility is an ML based approach to the standard recon-all
pipeline, and depends on pytorch. There are differences in the implementation of
pytorch on x86 and ARM system architectures.

This utility has been tested on Linux and MacOS, running on an Intel chipset.

On ARM based MacOS systems this utility may fail due to memory issues.
It is not recommended to run this utility on Silicon Macs.
