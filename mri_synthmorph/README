# SynthMorph

This README documents how to dockerize SynthMorph, an easy-to-use deep-learning
tool for brain-specific registration of images right off the MRI scanner
without preprocessing. General information on SynthMorph is available at:

    https://w3id.org/synthmorph

For instructions on how to set up and run the container, visit the repository

    https://hub.docker.com/r/freesurfer/synthmorph

Run `synthmorph -h` for help with using SynthMorph (or `mri_synthmorph -h` when
using the non-container version of the utility installed with FreeSurfer).


# Building Docker images

FreeSurfer releases will automatically include updates to the mri_synthmorph
script and weights files. Releasing stand-alone SynthMorph containers first
requires fetching the latest model files and replacing their symbolic links:

    git fetch datasrc
    git annex get .
    git annex unlock synthmorph*.h5

We build a new image with the appropriate tag and push it to the Docker Hub:

    ver=X
    docker build -t freesurfer/synthmorph:$ver .
    docker push freesurfer/synthmorph:$ver

We should also update the default "latest" tag, so that running `docker pull
freesurfer/synthmorph` without a tag will actually pull the most recent image.

    docker tag freesurfer/synthmorph:$ver freesurfer/synthmorph:latest
    docker push freesurfer/synthmorph:latest

Finally, we also update the version reference in the `synthmorph` wrapper
script for easy container handling and lock the annexed weight files again.

    sed -i "s/^\(version = \).*/\1$ver/" synthmorph
    git annex lock synthmorph*.h5


# Testing Singularity images before pushing

If you wish to test a container with Singularity (or, similarly, Apptainer) on
another machine before pushing it to the Docker Hub, first save the image.

    docker save synthmorph:$ver | gzip > synthmorph_$ver.tar.gz

If your home directory has a low quota, you may customize your environment,

    d=$(mktemp -d)
    export SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR="$d"
    export SINGULARITY_TMPDIR="$d"

Then build a SIF file as a non-root user with the fakeroot feature. This relies
on namespace mappings set up in /etc/subuid and /etc/subgid (by Help):

    singularity build -f image.sif docker-archive://synthmorph_$ver.tar.gz

Alternatively, you can directly convert the image without first saving it as a
tarball, if you run Docker and Singularity on the same machine:

    singularity build -f image.sif docker-daemon://freesurfer/synthmorph:$ver
